# Empathy Frontend Engineer Take-Home exercise

At [Empathy.co](https://empathy.co), we strive to deliver the best search experiences to our customers. As a **Frontend
Engineer**, you are expected to lead the way by combining creativity and technical skills. The goal of this exercise is
to get an understanding of how you apply those skills to one of our most common challenges: crafting a search interface.

Once finished, the code turned in will be the starting point of a conversation with our team. We would like to both
understand how you approached this exercise and get a glimpse of what collaborating with you on a real problem would
feel like.

## Description

For the exercise, we'd like you to build a web application that allows a user to search for artists, albums and tracks
on the Spotify catalog. To make it easier for you, instead of starting a repository from scratch, we’re providing you
with existing source code that you shall use as a base to build your solution. We have also prepared a step-by-step
guide to drive you through the exercise, starting with simpler tasks and adding more complexity to each step.

The idea is that you make your way by solving challenges that enable you to face the next one in an incremental way, so
you end up having a functional search application.

## Evaluation

As an Empathy **Frontend Engineer**, you will have to use your knowledge and skills to craft irresistible experiences.
Writing **clean code**, **architectural decisions**, **performance without compromising code clarity**,
**accessibility**, **testability**, **reliability**, **user experience** are just some of the topics that we will take
into account when reviewing the exercise. So even if the tasks do not explicitly talk about them, we suggest you to keep
them in your mind while solving the challenges. We will review this exercise as if you were our teammate. So go ahead
and show us your best!.

In the next step of the process we will start the conversation talking about your proposed solutions, and you will have
plenty of time to justify them, or even propose alternative paths to what you have submitted.

## What we won't evaluate

We appreciate your excitement, and that you are eager to show us your different skills. But to be fair, there are
certain things that we don't consider necessary in the exercise, even if they are great skills to have in a Frontend
Engineer. We can always talk about them in the following interview.

- You don't need to add a backend server. We are aware that the chosen authentication method is not suited for Frontend
  only applications, but we want to keep this part as simple as possible.
- You don't need to deploy the application. As long as we can run it locally it is fine.
- You don't need to translate the application into different languages.
- You don't need to add pagination. With the first batch of results it is enough.

⏱ Total expected effort: ~3h 30' _This is an estimation that we provide so you can have an idea of how long it may take
for you to take the exercise and as a reference to measure your progress while you work on it. It's based on the average
effort that other developers required to complete this same exercise before. But it's just a reference, don't worry if
you get stuck in some particular case and you go over the estimation for that step or if you finally needed more time to
accomplish the whole exercise._

We'd also like you to pick technologies that help us get clear signal on your FrontEnd fundamentals. For that reason, we
recommend that you stick to Typescript, modern JavaScript and vanilla CSS.

Think that we'd like to see how you perform as a Frontend Engineer. For this reason, components libraries, or CSS
frameworks such as Bootstrap or TailWind are **NOT allowed**, but CSS preprocessors or tools like PostCSS SASS, LESS
etc. are not only allowed but encouraged.

You can use the Spotify Web API to fetch all the necessary data.

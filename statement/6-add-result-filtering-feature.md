# 6. Add result filtering feature

As you progress through the exercise, you must demonstrate that you are capable of performing more complex tasks and
under less specific requirements. This time, we are requesting you to create a new component for filtering the results
and to add it to the search results view. The expectation is to filter the search results between albums, artists, and
tracks, but you can of course add other possible filters if you like.

It is **mandatory that you write some tests for this component**, so if you haven't written any until this point, now is
the moment to show us your testing skills.

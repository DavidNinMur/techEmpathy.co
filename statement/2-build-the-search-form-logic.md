# 2. Build the search form logic

Now that the communication with the API is established, you have to build the search form logic to fill the data that
must be presented to the user on the search page we provided. You must get the query from the input on the search form
and use it to retrieve the result data from the API. Then, you must return the data back to the search view to populate
the results. This is a great place to show us how you would build a nice search experience.

You can use the search method available in the `api/spotify.ts` file.

# 3. Add a new route

At this step, we request that you add a new route to the application. We provide you with a component that contains a
plain static HTML template for an artist detail page, and you have to integrate it into the application, make it
reachable from the search results page, and make it possible to go back to the search form from the detail view too.

Note that at this point you don't have to change the static template, neither fill it with data. You only have to make
sure users can visit this view from the search results list.

# 5. Detail page layout design

Now that the search detail view is reachable from the application, it’s time to show it to the user in a meaningful and
fancy way. Starting from the plain static HTML template provided along with the statement, you have to elaborate an HTML
structure to show the details of the search result and add styles to it.

Don't forget to use modern CSS techniques and semantic HTML. You can also add your own twist to the layout. Remember
that **CSS frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap are NOT allowed**. CSS preprocessors like SASS, LESS etc. are not
only allowed but encouraged, so you can add your own tooling to the project.
